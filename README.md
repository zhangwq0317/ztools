zcmd
====

If you are a Unix or Linux system administrator, and manage massive servers, you will feel very dummy to execute some commands on these servers one by one. There is a script which can help you reduce your effort and make your jobs more intersting. I named this zcmd, it can batch to build up the ssh/rsh trust function and execute the commands remotely.
